I created 3 table database with phpmyadmin but i wasnt able to use it for some reason I think I messed up the relations. so in order to make this app work at least I had to create just one table with name, number, image, user_name and address and pdf. Due to time issue I wasn't able to fully make the pdf part work so here is the partial working app that can add customer contact info, update, and delete. Thank you
